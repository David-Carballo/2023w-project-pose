## Dataset

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/dataset.png" />
</p>

### Original Dataset
In this case, we have got the [Yoga Postures Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tr1gg3rtrash/yoga-posture-dataset) that consists in 2756 images distributed in 47 classes like as shown in the following figure:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/newplot_0.png"/>
</p>


### Transformed Dataset

To fit images with our models, we have applied different transformations and data augmentation techniques.
* Resize tensor images to [255,255] and apply normalization with mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
* Data augmentation (with a 75% probability of being applied): HorizontalFlip(50%), GaussianBlur(50%), HueSaturationValue(50%) and ColorJitter(50%)

This dataset feeds the EfficientNet Model.

### Angles Dataset

To obtain the angles of the extracted poses from the original dataset, first, we have used a pretrained Open Pose model to extract all poses in a key points tensor. After that, we have applied an algorithm to compute the angles that forms each pose and its feed our Multilayer Perceptron model.

## Architecture and Models

### OpenPose

OpenPose is a deep learning-based approach for estimating the 2D and 3D pose of a human body from a single image or video. OpenPose works by first detecting body parts such as the head, torso, arms, and legs using a convolutional neural network (CNN). It then associates the detected body parts into body joints and estimates the pose of the body.

The model is trained on large datasets of annotated images and videos, making it robust to different lighting conditions, camera angles, and body shapes. OpenPose can be used in a variety of applications such as motion tracking, augmented reality, human-computer interaction, and animation.

### EfficientNetB3

EfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural network models that were designed to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while being computationally efficient.

EfficientNet models use a combination of scaling and compound scaling techniques to improve accuracy while reducing the number of parameters and computational cost. The basic idea is to increase the depth, width, and resolution of the model in a balanced way, which allows the model to learn more complex features and representations without requiring excessive resources. The models are pre-trained on large-scale image datasets such as ImageNet, which allows for transfer learning and fine-tuning on specific tasks with relatively small amounts of training data.

### MultiLayer Perceptron

A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of neural network that consists of multiple layers of neurons, each layer connected to the next layer. In this case, the MLP takes 13 angles as input and classifies them into 47 yoga posture classes.

The input layer of the MLP receives the 13 angles as input and is connected to the first hidden layer. Batch Normalization is applied after the input layer to standardize the inputs, which makes the training process more stable and speeds up the convergence of the network.
Dropout is applied to randomly drop out some of the neurons during training to prevent overfitting. 

Each hidden layer consists of multiple neurons, and the activation function used in each of these layers is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). ReLU is a non-linear activation function that introduces non-linearity to the model and helps the model to learn complex representations.

Finally, the output layer of the MLP consists of 47 neurons, one for each yoga posture class.

![](images/mlp2.png)

### Combined Model

A Combined MLP Model is a type of neural network that takes as input a 178 tensor generated by concatenating the output of two pre-existing models, the EfficientNet Model and the MLP Model. 

The EfficientNet Model is typically used for image classification, while the MLP Model is designed to classify data represented as a set of features or angles.

The model consists of one input layer and two hidden layers. Each hidden layer consists of multiple neurons, and the activation function used in these layers is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function.

After the final hidden layer, the output layer applies the Log Softmax activation function, which converts the output scores into probabilities. The probabilities indicate the likelihood of the input tensor belonging to each of the possible classes.

Overall, the Combined MLP Model takes advantage of the strengths of both the EfficientNet Model and the MLP Model, allowing for more accurate and robust classification of complex data.

### Alternative networks to EfficientNet:
Description and then which one we select.
Alternatives to EfficientNetB3, some options of convolutional neural network models:

* ResNet50: It is part of the ResNet family and uses residual connections to enable deep training. ResNet50 is a relatively deep model with 50 layers and has demonstrated outstanding performance in image classification tasks.

* VGG16: It is a model characterized by its simplicity and depth. VGG16 consists of 16 convolutional layers and uses 3x3 filters with small strides to learn features in the images. Although it is a heavier model in terms of parameters, it has been widely used and is known for its performance.

* DenseNet121: It is part of the DenseNet family and is based on the idea of dense connections. Instead of adding or concatenating features like in ResNet, DenseNet121 concatenates features from all previous layers, allowing for a richer flow of information and better gradient propagation.

* InceptionV3: It is a solid choice. It uses parallel convolutional filters of different sizes to capture features at different scales and levels of abstraction.

* Xception: This architecture is based on the idea of separating spatial convolution and channel convolution operations. Xception uses separable convolutions instead of standard convolutions, which reduces computational cost and allows for more efficient learning.

Selected network:

### InceptionV3
 ![](images/inceptionv3_arch.png)

InceptionV3 is a convolutional neural network architecture that was developed by Google as part of the Inception series of models. It was specifically designed for image classification and object detection tasks.

The distinctive feature of InceptionV3 is its use of parallel convolutional filters of different sizes (1x1, 3x3, 5x5) to capture features at different scales and levels of abstraction. These parallel filters are then concatenated and used in the next layer of the network.

Additionally, InceptionV3 utilizes what is known as "Inception blocks" that help reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity. These blocks combine the outputs of filters of different sizes through convolution and concatenation operations.

InceptionV3 has been trained on large datasets like ImageNet and has shown solid performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification and object detection.

You can find the implementation of InceptionV3 in different deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, making it easy to use and fine-tune on your own datasets and specific applications.

EfficientNet vs InceptionV3

Why we chose this network:
EfficientNet is optimized for low memory usage and fast inference, both of which are not requirements of the system, and a good accuracy is more important, which is what we have sought by attempting to merge different models. Therefore, we are going to use a deeper model with a more comprehensive combination of hyperparameters.

Pros and Cons EfficientNetB3 vs InceptionV3:

Both EfficientNetB3 and InceptionV3 are widely used convolutional neural network models with good performance in computer vision tasks. Here's a comparison of the pros and cons of EfficientNetB3 and InceptionV3:

* Pros of EfficientNetB3:

Efficiency in terms of performance: EfficientNetB3 is part of the EfficientNet family, which is specifically designed to achieve a good balance between performance and computational efficiency. These models typically have fewer parameters and operations compared to other architectures, making them more efficient in terms of training and deployment speed.

Better performance on large datasets: EfficientNetB3 has demonstrated outstanding performance on large datasets such as ImageNet, achieving high classification accuracy.

Scalability: The EfficientNet family offers a scale of pre-trained models (B0, B1, B2, B3, ...) that adapt to different available computational resources. This allows you to select the model that best suits your needs based on the available resources.

* Cons of EfficientNetB3:

Requires more computational resources: Although EfficientNetB3 is more efficient compared to many previous architectures, it may still require more computational resources than lighter models. If resources are limited, EfficientNetB3 may not be the best choice.

* Pros of InceptionV3:

Good ability to capture features at different scales: InceptionV3 uses parallel convolutional filters of different sizes, allowing it to capture contextual information at different scales. This can be beneficial in tasks that require object detection at different sizes or levels of detail.

Widely adopted and tested: InceptionV3 has been used and evaluated in various tasks and datasets, demonstrating solid performance in image classification and object detection.

* Cons of InceptionV3:

Higher computational complexity: InceptionV3 tends to have more parameters and operations compared to newer and more efficient models, leading to higher computational resource consumption and memory requirements.

Higher risk of overfitting: Due to its higher capacity and complexity, InceptionV3 can be more prone to overfitting, especially on smaller datasets. Careful fine-tuning or additional regularization techniques may be needed to avoid overfitting.

Ultimately, the choice between EfficientNetB3 and InceptionV3 depends on your specific needs, available computational resources, and the dataset you're working with. It's recommended to experiment and evaluate both models on your specific task to determine which one better suits your requirements.

## InceptionV3 Architecture:

Inception, by combining different network configurations into one, aligns with this requirement, and we are going to verify through training results if using a more comprehensive model leads to greater accuracy.

The architecture of InceptionV3 is a deep convolutional neural network consisting of multiple layers and modules. Here is an overview of the InceptionV3 architecture:

Input Layer: The input image is resized to a fixed size and passed through an initial convolutional layer.

Inception Module: The main building block of InceptionV3 is the Inception module, which is repeated multiple times throughout the network. The Inception module uses parallel convolutional filters of different sizes (1x1, 3x3, 5x5) to capture features at different scales.

Reduction Blocks: After some Inception modules, reduction blocks are used to reduce the spatial dimension of the representation. These blocks typically include 3x3 convolutions with larger strides to decrease the spatial resolution.

Global Average Pooling Layer: After the reduction blocks, a global average pooling layer is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the features. This layer averages the values in each feature map to generate a compact and flattened feature representation.

Fully Connected Layer: A fully connected layer is added with output units corresponding to the classes or categories to be predicted. The typical activation function used in the output layer is the softmax function for multiclass classification.

Overall, InceptionV3 is characterized by its use of parallel convolutional filters of different sizes to capture contextual information at different scales. This allows the network to capture features at different levels of abstraction and improve performance in classification and object detection tasks.

It is worth noting that the above description provides a high-level overview of the InceptionV3 architecture, but the complete details, including specific hyperparameters, can be found in publications and official documentation related to InceptionV3.

> For the following sections it is necessary that you are using the [YogaPostureCV notebook](YogaPostureCV.ipynb)

### MLP Model

To be able to run the model, first, we need to load the keypoints from the file [keypoints.csv](keypoints.csv) obtained from the instructions in the previous section.

```
load_keypoints = torch.load('keypoints')
```

After that, we can run all the cells to define the function that calculates the angles, the creation of the dataset, the creation of the MLP, and the functions train, validation and test.

### EfficientNet Model
In order to be able to run the EfficientNet model we first need to import the model from Torchvision. For this project, we use the EfficientNetB3 model with pretrained weights from ImageNet.

Next, we need to modify the final Sequential of the model so it is suited to our classification task with 47 classes, instead of the bigger number of classes in ImageNet.
```
img_model = torchvision.models.efficientnet_b3(weights='DEFAULT')
#Substitution of the model's classifier so it predicts between the 47 classes of the Dataset instead of the 1000 of Imagenet, along with other changes to combat Overfitting
img_model.classifier = nn.Sequential(
    nn.BatchNorm1d(1536, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True),
    nn.Linear(in_features=1536, out_features=50, bias=True),
    nn.Dropout(p=0.5, inplace=True),
    nn.Linear(in_features=50, out_features=47, bias=True),
    nn.LogSoftmax(dim = -1) 
```

### Intermediate Feature extraction
In order to obtain the features obtained by the model we need to take their output before the final Linear layer. To do this, we will cut the models after the penultimate Linear layer. We will also save a state_dict of both models before cutting so we can restore the parameters to their values post-training. After the slicing of the models, we have a loading state_dict cell.

Important: **Do not run the slicing cell more than once or the rest of the notebook will not work**

```
torch.save(img_model.state_dict(), '/content/img_model_state_dict')
torch.save(mlp.state_dict(), '/content/angle_mlp_state_dict')
```
```
###WARNING: DO NOT RUN THIS CELL MORE THAN ONCE OR THE REST OF THE NOTEBOOK WILL NOT WORK
img_model.classifier = img_model.classifier[:-3]
mlp = nn.Sequential(*(list(mlp.children())[:-2]))

mlp.to(device)
img_model.to(device)
```
```
img_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('/content/img_model_state_dict'), strict = False)
mlp.load_state_dict(torch.load('/content/angle_mlp_state_dict'), strict = False)
```

### Final Classification Model
For the final classification model, we will need a model that takes a concatenation of the previous 2 models' extracted features and processes them to generate a prediction. In order to do this, we will need an input size that is the sum of the lengths of both outputs, and an output size that is equal to the number of classes. If we want this model to work correctly, we need to make sure the input given to the 2 previous models is the same.
```
class CombinedMLP(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
    super(CombinedMLP, self).__init__()
    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
    self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    self.batch = nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_size)
    self.drop1 = nn.Dropout(0.4)
    self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
    self.drop2 = nn.Dropout(0.4)
    self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
    self.logsoftmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim = -1)

  def forward(self, x):
    out = self.fc1(x)
    out = self.relu(out)
    out = self.batch(out)
    out = self.drop1(out)
    out = self.fc2(out)
    out = self.relu(out)
    out = self.drop2(out)
    out = self.fc3(out)
    out = self.logsoftmax(out)

    return out
```

<!-- EXPERIMENTS -->
## Experiments
### Angles

To test and improve our AngleMLP model, we have done different experiments from changing the way of obtaining the angles to applying Data Augmentation techniques. 

#### Get Angles From Previous Keypoint

One of the first approaches we used to calculate angles from the extracted keypoints was to calculate the angle of each keypoint with respect to the previous keypoint. That is, as each connection consists of two points A and B, we placed the center of coordinates at point A and calculated the angle of the vector formed by AB.

However, we realized that this approach did not adequately represent the yoga pose because we could obtain similar representations for completely different poses.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/angles1.png" width="300">
</p>


#### Get Angles From Reference Vector

The next approach we tested was to calculate the angles formed by each connection with a reference vector connecting the neck key point to the hip center. This improved the difference between poses a bit, but we still had problems, for example, in a posture where the person was standing or lying down.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/angles2.PNG">
</p>

#### Get Angles From Previous Vector

Therefore, we used an approach similar to those used in robotics to calculate the movement of joints in a chain kinematics. This allowed us to represent the angle of a joint as a reference to the previous joints, giving us a more accurate representation of each pose. To do this, we first calculated an initial vector that served as a reference to determine if the pose was standing or lying down, and then we traversed the joints of the whole body, calculating the angle that they formed.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/angles3.PNG">
</p>

#### Angles Overfitting

As we had images where OpenPose had not correctly extracted the poses, which resulted in poses with very few or non-existent key points, and we also had a dataset with some classes with few images, this caused overfitting to occur when training our angle model.

#### Hypothesis

To solve this problem, we believed that applying Data Augmentation by adding some noise to the angles and removing those poses and classes that did not provide enough data would result in a model that would better generalize to unseen angles.

#### Setup

To apply noise by adding an alpha value to the angle tensor with a probability of 75%.
```
if prob < 0.75:
        n = random.uniform(-alpha,alpha) * math.pi / 180
        angles = angles + n
```
With this solution, our model increased its accuracy by around 5%, while also reducing overfitting to some extent.

To eliminate angles and classes that do not provide sufficient information:
```
for i in range(0,len(angles)): 
        if torch.count_nonzero(angles[i]) > 0:
        new_angles.append(angles[i])
        new_labels.append(self.labels[i])
```

But in this case, we saw that overfitting was still appearing and the model was not improving much, so we decided not to use this option.

#### Results

Training Accuracy: 82,698%

Test Accuracy: 42,02%

Plot of train and val accuracy during training:

![](images/accuracyangles.png)

#### Conclusions

As we have seen, increasing some noise did improve the model, but having such a limited dataset and not having extracted all the poses with their necessary key points, we have a model that does not work properly.

### EfficientNet vs MobileNet
Initially, MobileNetV3_Small was the chosen model for the image processing section of this project due to it's lightweight design, however, while exploring other notebooks uploaded to Kaggle using the same dataset, we discovered that by using EfficientNetB3 we could get a similar performance with fewer training epochs (and time).

#### Hypothesis
By running the same training loop and the same data through both models with the same classifier architecture, we can get the same accuracy in test with less training epochs.

#### Setup
MobilenetV3_Small: Default architecture except classifier, ImageNet pretrained weights.

EfficientNetB3: Default architecture except classifier, ImageNet pretrained weights.

Classifier architecture:
```
(classifier): Sequential(
    (0): Linear(in_features=1536, out_features=50, bias=True)
    (1): Linear(in_features=50, out_features=47, bias=True)
    (2): LogSoftmax(dim=-1)
```

Criterion and Optimizer:
```
criterion = nn.NLLLoss()
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr = 1e-4, weight_decay = 0.01)
```


#### Results
MobilenetV3_Small:

Test Acc: 68.372

Epochs: 10

EfficientNetB3:

Test Acc: 70.510

Epochs: 6

#### Conclusions
We can reduce the number of training epochs and, since every epoch takes a similar amount of time on both models, the time it takes to train the model to achieve a given test score.

### EfficientNet Overfitting
Initially, the EfficientNet model was experiencing big overfitting, with differences between train accuracy and val/test accuracy of around 20 percentage points, with test accuracy maxing out at around 73% after 12 Epochs of training even with Data Augmentation already applied.

#### Hypothesis
By applying techniques that help with overfitting, such as Dropout, Weight Decay, and modifying the Hidden layer Size, amongst others, we can increase test accuracy.

#### Setup
EfficientNetB3: Default architecture except classifier, ImageNet pretrained weights.

Classifier architecture:
```

optimizer = optim.AdamW(
    [
        {"params": img_model.features.parameters(), "lr": 1e-5},
        {"params": img_model.classifier.parameters(), "lr": 1e-4},

#### Conclusions
By applying Batch Normalization, Dropout, weight_decay and a learning rate scheduler, we managed to increase the test accuracy slightly. However, the improvement was not very big and the difference between Training and Test accuracy was quite big, meaning that there was still overfitting. Given that data augmentation was already applied, the best ideal solution would be to obtain a larger amount of images to train the model with.

### Combined MLP
The original and main goal of this project was to take an image-based approach to the classification task for this dataset, and combine it with pose information to hopefully improve the performance. 

To achieve this, we took the previously explained models and used their outputs as input for a final MLP that goes on to make the final classification.

#### Hypothesis
By training the EfficientNet and the AnglesMLP models separately, taking the features (before predictions) that these models output and then combining them to feed them into another MLP model, we can improve the test accuracy compared to the EfficientNet predictions.

#### Setup
Dataset:
```
class CombinedDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, dataset1, dataset2):
        self.d1 = dataset1
        self.d2 = dataset2
    
    def __getitem__(self, index):
        img, label1 = self.d1.__getitem__(index)
        angle, label2 = self.d2.__getitem__(index)

        if label1 != label2:
            print("[ERROR] Different labels with same index") 
        
        return img, angle, label1

    def __len__(self):
        if self.d1.__len__() != self.d2.__len__():
            print("[ERROR] Different size of datasets")

    out = self.relu(out)
    out = self.drop2(out)

#### Results
After 30 epochs of training:

Train accuracy: 84.82%
Val accuracy: 74.23%
**Test accuracy: 76.81%**
These results can vary by about 0-2% depending on the exact run

### InceptionV3 results
fretne al 76 % de preciosion, efficencet que apenas pudo mejorar elsistema combinada ( con lo que deducioms que modelo combiando con poenpose no aportea valor) hemos conseguido alcanzar con uinceptio un 86% de preciosn , una considerable mejora del 10% en 10  eopcas para el mismo dataset

#### Conclusions
The performance increase (outside of training accuracy) stalls at around Epoch 21, with only very slightly higher values to using only the EfficientNet model. Having seen the low test performance from the AnglesMLP model, and high overfitting on both models, we can draw two main conclussions:

1. An increase in the performance of the AnglesMLP could potentially mean an improvement in the test performance of the CombinedMLP model.

2. The low amount of images provided by the dataset has shown to be a big obstacle through all the different stages of this project, to the point that, even with    techniques aimed at reducing overfitting, we could only slightly mitigate the problem.

### InceptionV3 consucion
Tras realizar el experimiento con uanr red mas compe,lta,  verificamos que labaja preciosn no se debe solo a la cantaidad de datos, y al overfitting,
Esta claro,imveptopn esta sindo capaz de generaliza con la misma cantidad de datos mejor.
